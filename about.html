                <h3>Arsalan Ahmad Khan</h3>
                <p>Founder & CEO</p>
                <p>Arsalan Ahmad Khan is the founder of Paws & Tails, an organization that helps puppies in need find forever homes. Paws & Tails is an organization that specializes in rescuing puppies and providing them with the necessary care and training to successfully rehome them.

Khan is a lifelong animal lover, and he is a huge advocate for animals. He has more than two years of experience in animal welfare. In the two years he has been caring for animals in need, Khan has changed the lives of countless puppies. This includes providing them with the food and water they need, a safe space to rest, and all the love and attention they could possibly ask for.

Khanâ€™s tireless efforts also help overwhelmed shelters throughout the country. Shelter staff are able to focus on their primary duties thanks to the help from Khan and his organization. Paws & Tails is truly making a difference in the lives of all the pups and facilities they assist.

The experience and knowledge Khan has gained over the past two years makes an immediate impact with the pups he deals with. He knows that pups at shelters must be shown as much compassion and love as possible, so he works tirelessly to show each and every one as much affection as he can. When you work with animals as long as Khan has, you see a lot of heartache. You also see a lot of good times, and Khan seems to know just how to deal with both.

Khan is changing lives every day with his hard work and dedication. He has a kind heart and a clear passion for the work he does. The team at Paws & Tails is so lucky to have him at the helm of their organization.</p>
