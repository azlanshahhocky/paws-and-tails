            <h3>Training and Socialization</h3>
            <p>Training your puppy early is essential for their development. Start with basic commands like "sit," "stay," "come," and "down." Use positive reinforcement techniques with treats and praise. Socialization helps them become well-adjusted adults - expose your puppy to different environments, people, other dogs, and various sounds during their critical socialization period (3-14 weeks). Enroll in puppy classes for structured training and socialization opportunities.</p>
            <h4>Key Training Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep training sessions short (5-10 minutes) and fun</li>
                <li>Be consistent with commands and rewards</li>
                <li>Start potty training immediately with a regular schedule</li>
                <li>Practice crate training for a safe space</li>
                <li>Address unwanted behaviors early (jumping, biting, barking)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Health and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Proper nutrition is vital for your puppy's growth. Ensure they receive a balanced diet with the right amount of protein (22-32%), fats (8-20%), and carbohydrates. Choose age-appropriate puppy food with high-quality ingredients. Regular vet check-ups are crucial - puppies need vaccinations, deworming, and health screenings.</p>
            <h4>Health Checklist:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Schedule regular vet visits (every 3-4 weeks until 16 weeks old)</li>
                <li>Keep vaccination records up to date</li>
                <li>Administer monthly flea, tick, and heartworm prevention</li>
                <li>Monitor weight and adjust food portions accordingly</li>
                <li>Provide fresh water at all times</li>
                <li>Watch for signs of illness (lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Grooming and Hygiene</h3>
            <p>Regular grooming keeps your puppy clean and healthy. Depending on their breed, this may include daily or weekly brushing, monthly bathing, and nail trimming every 3-4 weeks. Start grooming routines early to help your puppy become comfortable with handling. Regular grooming also helps you bond with your puppy and allows you to check for skin issues, parasites, or injuries.</p>
            <h4>Grooming Schedule:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> Daily for long-haired breeds, weekly for short-haired</li>
                <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> Once a month or as needed (avoid over-bathing)</li>
                <li><strong>Nail Trimming:</strong> Every 3-4 weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Ear Cleaning:</strong> Weekly inspection, clean as needed</li>
                <li><strong>Teeth Brushing:</strong> Daily or at least 3 times per week</li>
                <li><strong>Eye Cleaning:</strong> Daily for breeds prone to tear stains</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exercise and Play</h3>
            <p>Regular exercise is important for your puppy's physical and mental health. The general rule is 5 minutes of exercise per month of age, twice daily. For example, a 4-month-old puppy needs about 20 minutes of exercise, two times a day. Ensure they get plenty of playtime, walks, and mental stimulation to keep them active, happy, and prevent destructive behaviors.</p>
            <h4>Exercise Ideas:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Short walks around the neighborhood</li>
                <li>Play fetch in a secure area</li>
                <li>Tug-of-war games</li>
                <li>Puzzle toys for mental stimulation</li>
                <li>Puppy playdates with vaccinated dogs</li>
                <li>Swimming (for water-loving breeds)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sleep and Rest</h3>
            <p>Puppies need plenty of sleep - up to 18-20 hours per day! Provide a comfortable, quiet sleeping area. Establish a bedtime routine and stick to it. A well-rested puppy is a happy, well-behaved puppy. Avoid over-stimulation before bedtime and ensure they've had a potty break.</p>

            <h3>Safety and Puppy-Proofing</h3>
            <p>Puppy-proof your home to keep your furry friend safe. Remove hazards like electrical cords, toxic plants, small objects that could be swallowed, and secure cabinets with cleaning supplies. Use baby gates to restrict access to certain areas. Supervise your puppy at all times until they're fully trained.</p>
            <h4>Safety Checklist:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove toxic plants (lilies, azaleas, sago palms)</li>
                <li>Secure trash cans and recycling bins</li>
                <li>Keep medications and chemicals out of reach</li>
                <li>Cover electrical outlets and hide cords</li>
                <li>Store small items that could be choking hazards</li>
                <li>Install baby gates on stairs</li>
            </ul>
