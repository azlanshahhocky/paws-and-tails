            <h3>High-Quality Ingredients</h3>
            <p>Selecting the right food for your puppy can be overwhelming. Look for high-quality ingredients, appropriate for their age and breed. Consult with a veterinarian for personalized advice.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Types of Food</h3>
            <p>There are various types of puppy food available, including dry, wet, and raw. Each type has its benefits. Dry food is convenient and helps clean teeth, while wet food is more palatable and hydrating.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Feeding Schedules</h3>
            <p>Establishing a regular feeding schedule helps maintain your puppy's health. Puppies generally need to eat more frequently than adult dogs. Follow the guidelines on the food packaging and adjust based on your puppy's needs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h3>Portion Control</h3>
            <p>Proper portion control is crucial to prevent overfeeding. Use a measuring cup to ensure you are giving the right amount of food. Adjust portions based on your puppy's weight and activity level.</p>
